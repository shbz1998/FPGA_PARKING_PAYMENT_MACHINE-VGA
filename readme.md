# FPGA PARKING PAYMENT MACHINE ON ZYBO Z7-10
## SHAHBAZ HASSAN KHAN MALIK

This is an FPGA Parking Payment machine based on the foundational concepts of "Finite State Machine"
built on ZYBO Z7-10 using PMOD KEYPAD and VGA. 

An FSM is used for jumping between menu promts. The menu is shown on a 1080p display using
VGA driver. 

Digilent's PMOD KEYPAD is used in the design to let the user navigate through the different "states" (menu options)
as follows:

1-Welcome Screen
2-Menu
3-Number of Days
4-Insert Card
